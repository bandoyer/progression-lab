# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
This project is pre-1.0 and under active development. Security fixes are applied to the `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, please **do not** open a public issue with details.
Instead, contact me privately (open a GitHub discussion marked private if available, or email listed on my profile).
I will confirm receipt within a few days and work on a fix. After a patch is released, Iâ€™ll credit reporters who want to be acknowledged.

## Dependencies
This repository uses GitHub Dependabot to monitor NuGet packages and GitHub Actions. Automated PRs are reviewed and merged after CI passes.
