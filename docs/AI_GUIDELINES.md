# ProgressionLab – AI Guidelines

## Pull Request summaries
- Write a **crisp, bullet-style** summary.
- Fill these sections exactly: **What**, **Why**, **How I tested**, **Impact**, **Risks & Rollback**, **Notes**.
- Keep “What” to 3–6 bullets, start each with a **verb**.
- In **Impact**, call out API endpoints, DB migrations, security/privacy, performance, and observability (logs/metrics/traces).
- If a section doesn’t apply, write **N/A**.
- List 3–5 **most-impacted files** when relevant.
- Prefer present tense; avoid marketing language.

## Tone & format
- Plain, technical English; short sentences.
- No speculation or claims not supported by the diff/commits.
